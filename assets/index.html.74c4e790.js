Apple&#39;s mobile operating system is known for its security and that&#39;s partly because of how locked-down it is. Jailbreaking your device will allow you to break those restrictions and customize your device to how you like it.</p><p>Jailbreaking gives you the ability to install custom applications and &quot;tweaks&quot; (modifications) from a package manager to customize and enhance the user experience. Jailbreaking is free and easy on most devices.</p><h3 id="is-jailbreaking-legal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-jailbreaking-legal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Is jailbreaking legal?</h3><p>Jailbreaking in the US is perfectly legal. In 2010, the US Copyright Office declared jailbreaking to be an exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p><p>You may want to check in your country whether it is legal there or not before proceeding, however in most countries it should be fine.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-package-manager" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-package-manager" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is a package manager?</h3><p>Package managers are used to install, uninstall and modify official or community-made software to customize your device. Sileo is an example of a package manager.</p><p>They can be considered similar to the iOS App Store, where you can install both free and paid software.</p><h3 id="what-s-a-repo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-a-repo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What&#39;s a repo?</h3><p>These are essentially databases that contain lots of tweaks for you to install. When you add repos to your package manager, you will be able to install the tweaks contained on it, and look for them using the search function.</p><h3 id="what-are-tweaks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-tweaks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are tweaks?</h3><p>Tweaks are small modifications that can be installed change the look and/or feel of your device.</p><p>Unlike apps, tweaks usually don&#39;t come with an app icon, but rather instead an area in the Settings app to change how the tweak acts. Some simpler tweaks might not even have this.</p><h3 id="what-is-respringing-or-restarting-springboard" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-respringing-or-restarting-springboard" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is &quot;respringing&quot; or &quot;Restarting Springboard&quot;?</h3><p>Respringing is essentially restarting the home screen and the iOS UI. Most of the time, you can install a tweak and respring to apply it, without fully rebooting.</p><p>You won&#39;t have to reinstall an exploit after respringing, however, and you can remain jailbroken.</p><h3 id="what-is-recovery-mode" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-recovery-mode" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is Recovery Mode?</h3><p>Recovery Mode is a protection built-in to your device that allows the user to completely start over with a fresh install of iOS. This is especially useful if the installed OS is damaged and cannot start properly, which can happen during jailbreaks, although rare. Entering recovery mode can be done on device and through a computer, and iTunes/Finder utilise recovery mode during normal upgrades and restores.</p><h3 id="what-is-dfu-mode" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-dfu-mode" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is DFU mode?</h3>',21),u=e("DFU mode is a way you can interact with your iOS device without loading the operating system or boot loader. It stands for Device Firmware Upgrade. It's functionally different from recovery mode and is generally intended as a last resort in case things seriously go wrong on your device, however we can use it with "),b=e("Odysseyra1n"),p=e(" to jailbreak your device instead.
